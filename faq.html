                            <p> VulnPoint is the world's leading exploit acquisition platform for premium zero-days and
                                advanced cybersecurity research.

                                Founded in 2015 by cybersecurity veterans with unparalleled experience in zero-day
                                research and exploitation, VulnPoint is now a global community of independent security
                                researchers working together to provide the most powerful cybersecurity capabilities to
                                institutional clients.

                                VulnPoint pays the highest bounties in the market to reward researchers and acquire
                                their
                                zero-days. We believe that this is the only way to support the zero-day research
                                community and capture the most advanced and innovative research from all around the
                                world.

                            What is the difference between VulnPoint and other bug bounty programs?
                        </div>
                        <div class="accordion__body">
                            <p> The majority of existing vulnerability acquisition platforms focus on quantity rather
                                than quality hence they usually acquire any kind of vulnerabilities or PoCs but pay very
                                low rewards. VulnPoint pays much higher bounties as we only focus on acquiring high-risk
                                vulnerabilities with fully functional/reliable exploits.

                                Furthermore, VulnPoint acquisition process and payments are simple, straightforward, and
                                very fast (the whole submission processing and payment is usually completed within a
                                week or less).

                                Finally, at VulnPoint we take ethics very seriously and we choose our customers very
                                carefully through a very strict due diligence and vetting process. Access to acquired
                                zero-day research is highly restricted and is limited to a very small number of
                                institutional clients.
